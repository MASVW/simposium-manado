Simposium Manado



## Problem

This website has a proposal for a medical School in Sam Ratulangi University. After a long time, this organization does an event called Simposium every 6 months. This event is paid, so every participant needs to pay a price that belongs to each event that users participate in. They found some not effectiveness in their system.They need to do manual validation with payment participants and forward certification for each participant for each event where this system is wasting a lot of time. 

## Solution

With an application/website that can automatically do validation participant payment and automatically make and send certificates after events end.
